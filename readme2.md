# Game of War - Card Game

### Theme - Pokemon

## Objective: 
Create the card game War as a browser-based game. The game of war is a simple card game that follows a defined game logic. The premise of the game is simple; each player receives half of the deck after it has been shuffled. Both players will play a card, and the player that played the higher card takes both cards. This cycle continues until a player has run out of cards and loses the game. 

The game's namesake occurs when both players play the same number card. This triggers a "War", where both players provide three additional hostages and play another card to resolve the "War". If this happens three times in a row, a "Triple War", then the game is a draw, and it is over.

In my version of this game, Aces are considered to be the lowest card, while King is the highest.

## Motivation:
War was one of the first card games I ever learned, makeing it one of the first games I ever learned, period. I am trying to recreate this classic card game with a theme from another childhood classic, Pokemon.
